# CITU Course Scheduler

This is a simple web application built by a student to help with course planning and scheduling.

## What it does (or tries to do!)

This tool is designed to:

*   Allow users to input their course data.
*   Filter courses based on availability, time, day, and section type.
*   Help identify potential conflicts between chosen courses.
*   Generate possible timetable combinations from a list of courses.
*   Offer different views for course data and schedules.
*   Save user preferences like theme and filters.

It's a small hobby project, so it's a work in progress!
