## About The Project

Navigating course enlistment and manually creating a feasible class schedule can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience for students. The CITU Course Builder aims to alleviate this by providing an intuitive, powerful, and responsive tool. Users can import their available courses, set various preferences and filters, and let the application generate optimal, conflict-free schedules. With local data persistence, students can pick up their planning where they left off. Recent enhancements include robust export functionalities for both course lists and timetable views.

## Usage

Once the application is running:

1.  **Import Data:** Navigate to your institution's portal (e.g., AIMS for CIT-U students), copy the table of available courses. Paste this tab-separated data into the "Raw Data Input" text area in the CITU Course Builder and click "Import Data."
2.  **Manage Courses:** View your imported courses in the table. You can sort, group, and delete courses.
3.  **Set Preferences & Filters:** Configure your maximum units, preferred class gap, preferred time of day, and apply filters like day/time exclusions, section types, or course status.
4.  **Lock Courses:** Lock any specific course sections you absolutely need in your schedule. Conflicts with other locked courses will be highlighted.
5.  **Generate Schedule:** Choose a schedule generation mode ("Recommended," "Full Coverage," or "Quick") and click "Generate Best Schedule." The application will attempt to find an optimal, conflict-free schedule based on your settings.
6.  **View Timetable:** Locked courses (either manually locked or from a generated schedule) will appear in the weekly timetable.
7.  **Export:** Use the hamburger menus in the course list and timetable sections to:
    * Export course data as `.txt` or to clipboard (tab-separated format for re-import)
    * Export timetable view as high-fidelity PNG or PDF files
8.  **Customize Theme:** Switch between Light/Dark modes and choose between 'Original'/'Comfort' color palettes. The system remembers your palette choices between sessions.

All your settings, imported courses, and locked courses are automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so you can close the tab and resume later.
